As a Digital Engineer/Structural Engineer, I am focused on developing digital and sustainable solutions in civil and structural engineering. 
My interest spans multiple areas, including digital engineering, machine learning, data science, finite element modelling and timber structures. My ultimate goal is to address problems that have wide-ranging significance, develop methods that are both accessible and effective, and built intelligent systems that can improve human lives.

**Previously:** I received my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from <a href='https://www.unsw.edu.au/'>University of New South Wales (UNSW Syndey)</a>. During my study, I colaborated with many well recognized researchers such as [A/Prof Hamid Valipour](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/hamid-vali-pour-goudarzi) at UNSW Sydney and [Dr. Stefania Fortino](https://cris.vtt.fi/en/persons/stefania-fortino) at VTT Finland.
